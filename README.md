ZooNumPyIndexing Program

It's often confusing to learning indexing with multi-dimensional arrays. I created this simple Zoo for practicing indexing: both zero-based and negative.

This is perfect for Python 101 courses. Create a Zoom array of your choice and ask students to find different animals or group of animals with zero-based and negative indexing. I found this method more effective than working with numbers. When working with the Zoo, if you need a specific animal for a treatment or vet visit, you need that and only that animal: this makes it clearer that when I use dry number examples. Of course the importance of indexing is clear in real-life applications but those applications are often to complex to use in Python 101.
